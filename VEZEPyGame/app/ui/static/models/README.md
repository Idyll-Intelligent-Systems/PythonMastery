# Models

Place your GLTF/GLB models here, for example `hero.glb` with Idle/Walk/Run animation clips.

Tips:

- Keep polygon counts moderate for web.
- Use baked lighting where appropriate.
- Ensure clip names match expected strings: Idle, Walk, Run.
- If using Draco compression, also vendor DRACOLoader and configure it in the loader.
