# Vendor loaders

Place three.js example loaders here, e.g. GLTFLoader.js, DRACOLoader.js.

Recommended sources:

- three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js (from the three.js release matching your runtime)
- three/examples/jsm/loaders/DRACOLoader.js (optional, for compressed assets)

Versioning tip: Keep the loader version aligned with the three.js version used by the app to avoid incompatibilities.
